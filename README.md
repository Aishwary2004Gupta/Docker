- **No Spoon-Feeding**: Solve problems with minimal guidance to build confidence and critical thinking.
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Learn concepts that are directly applicable to real-world Docker implementations.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (latest version)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands and YAML (optional but helpful)
